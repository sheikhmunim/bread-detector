# Bread Detector Project

A practical project to build a bread detection system for bakery packaging.  
Includes a machine learning model for bread type classification and an app for real-time detection.

## Structure:
- `model/` - Machine learning training and model files.
- `app/` - App development (mobile, web, backend).

## Workflow:
- ML and app development are done in separate branches.
- Final models will be integrated into the app.
